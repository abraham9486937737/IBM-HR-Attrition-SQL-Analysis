# Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Objective
To transform coded HR attributes into meaningful, human-readable values
using SQL conditional logic, enabling cleaner and more interpretable analysis.

---

## Cleaning Techniques Applied
- CASE statements for categorical mappings
- Derived columns for satisfaction levels
- Creation of a clean analytical SQL View

---

## Output
A reusable SQL view (`vw_hr_attrition_clean`) that standardizes key
attributes such as education, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

---

## Benefit
This approach preserves raw data integrity while providing a clean
foundation for intermediate and advanced analytical queries.
