🔍 Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to help the HR team reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.

📈 Key Findings (What We Found)
1️⃣ Overall Attrition Overview

Total Employees: 1,470

Employees Who Left: 237

Overall Attrition Rate: ~16%

📌 This attrition rate is significant and indicates the need for targeted retention strategies.

2️⃣ Department-Wise Attrition

HR has a small workforce but notable attrition percentage

🔍 Insight:

Employees with Better or Best work-life balance show much lower attrition

🔍 Insight:
Poor work-life balance directly contributes to employee exits.

5️⃣ Compensation & Attrition

Many attrited employees fall into lower monthly income ranges

Attrition is higher among employees with slower income growth

🔍 Insight:
Compensation fairness and growth opportunities play a crucial role in retention.

6️⃣ Career Level & Experience

Entry-level and Junior-Mid level employees experience higher attrition

Attrition reduces at senior and executive levels

🔍 Insight:
Early-career employees are more vulnerable to dissatisfaction and job switching.

7️⃣ Business Travel & Distance from Home

Employees who travel frequently have higher attrition

Employees living closer to work tend to stay longer

🔍 Insight:
Travel fatigue and long commute times negatively affect employee retention.
